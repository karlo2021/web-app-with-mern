## Seperate script file

In all the previous sections, the transformation of JSX to JavaScript happens at runtime. This is inefficient and quite unnecessary. Letâ€™s instead move the transformation to the build stage in our development. As the first step, we need to separate out the JSX and JavaScript from the all-in-one index.html and
refer to it as an external script. This way, we can keep the HTML as pure HTML and all the script that needs compilation in a separate file.
<br />
Call this external script App.jsx and place it in the public directory, so that it can be referred to as /App.jsx from the browser. Replace the inline script with a reference to an external source like this:


```js
  ...
  <script type="text/babael" src="App.jsx></script>
  ...
```

Note that the script type text/babel continues to be needed, since the JSX compilation happens in the browser using the Babel library.
Point your browser to [localhoost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you should see the same Hello World message. But we have only separated the files; we
have not moved the transform to build time.
