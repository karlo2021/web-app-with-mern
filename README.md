# Express & GraphQL

Until now, the only resource the Express and Node.js server was serving was static content in the form of index.html. In this chapter, we’ll start fetching and storing the data using APIs from the Express and Node.js server in addition to the static HTML file. This will replace the hard-coded array of issues in the browser’s memory.

We will not persist the data on disk; instead, we’ll just use a simulated database in the server’s memory. We will leave actual persistence to the next chapter.
