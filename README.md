## Composing Components

Itâ€™s possible to build a component that uses other user-defined components. Component composition is one of the most powerful features of React. This way, the UI can be split into smaller independent pieces.

Return of render() has to be a single element, these elements have to be enclosed within a <div> or a React Fragment component. The Fragment component is like an enclosing <div> but it has no effect on the DOM.
